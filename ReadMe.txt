This is a web-based system for managing license texts-like the SPDX License List but oriented towards other private collections of licenses. 
We developed a Web based Application with a consideration to use open source Technologies. The Application was created on a Three tier architecture with Light front end tier, all business functionality included in the Middle tier and Database as the Data Tier. 
•	Front end Tier: Front end was developed using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Boot strap, datatables, Chart.js.
•	Middle Tier: the Business logic was developed on Python Django.
•	Back End/ Data Layer: SQLite was the database we choose to persist the data.

Modules were created in the application with provisioning the User management, License data management, UI Analytics. A detailed description, along with the documentation and user manuals is provided in the branch - 'Documents'
